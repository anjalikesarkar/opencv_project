OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) - Image processing library

# Basic Image Processing Folder Notebooks:
- Blank Images (Blank Images nb): Demonstrates how to create blank images using OpenCV.
- Color (Color nb): Covers reading, displaying, and manipulating color images in different color spaces.
- Draw on Image (Draw on image nb): Shows how to draw basic shapes and text on images.
- Basic Image Processing (Basic image processing nb): Covers fundamental image manipulation techniques like resizing, rotating, and flipping.
- Image Slideshow (Image slide show nb): Creates an image slideshow that cycles through multiple images.
- Image Transformation (Image transformation nb): Demonstrates advanced image transformations like affine and perspective transformations.

# Advanced Image Processing Folder Notebooks:
- Blur Image (Blur_Image nb): Demonstrates image blurring techniques using Gaussian and Median blur filters.
- Corner Detection (corner detection nb): Shows how to detect corners in images using the Harris corner detection method.
- Edge Detection (Edge detection nb): Implements edge detection using the Canny edge and Sobel filters.
- Hist BG Remover (Hist bg remover nb): Uses histograms to remove backgrounds from images.
- Histogram (Histogram nb): Calculates and displays the histogram of an image to analyze pixel intensity distribution.
- Mouse Event (mouse event nb): Demonstrates how to handle mouse events like left and right button clicks in OpenCV.
- Object Scanner (Obejc scanner nb): Uses image masking to scan and isolate objects within an image.
- GrabCut (grabcut nb): Implements the GrabCut algorithm to segment and cut objects from an image using a background and foreground mask.
- Image Morphism (image morphism nb): Covers various image morphing techniques like dilation, erosion, and opening/closing.
- Thresholding (thresholding nb): Demonstrates simple thresholding and Otsu's method for image binarization.
