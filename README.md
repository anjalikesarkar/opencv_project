# opencv_basics
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) - Image processing library

# Basic Image Processing Folder Notebooks:
- Blank Images (Blank Images nb): Demonstrates how to create blank images using OpenCV.
- Color (Color nb): Covers reading, displaying, and manipulating color images in different color spaces.
- Draw on Image (Draw on image nb): Shows how to draw basic shapes and text on images.
- Basic Image Processing (Basic image processing nb): Covers fundamental image manipulation techniques like resizing, rotating, and flipping.
- Image Slideshow (Image slide show nb): Creates an image slideshow that cycles through multiple images.
- Image Transformation (Image transformation nb): Demonstrates advanced image transformations like affine and perspective transformations.

# Advanced Image Processing Folder Notebooks:
- Blur Image (Blur_Image nb): Demonstrates image blurring techniques using Gaussian and Median blur filters.
- Corner Detection (corner detection nb): Shows how to detect corners in images using the Harris corner detection method.
- Edge Detection (Edge detection nb): Implements edge detection using the Canny edge and Sobel filters.
- Hist BG Remover (Hist bg remover nb): Uses histograms to remove backgrounds from images.
- Histogram (Histogram nb): Calculates and displays the histogram of an image to analyze pixel intensity distribution.
- Mouse Event (mouse event nb): Demonstrates how to handle mouse events like left and right button clicks in OpenCV.
- Object Scanner (Obejc scanner nb): Uses image masking to scan and isolate objects within an image.
- GrabCut (grabcut nb): Implements the GrabCut algorithm to segment and cut objects from an image using a background and foreground mask.
- Image Morphism (image morphism nb): Covers various image morphing techniques like dilation, erosion, and opening/closing.
- Thresholding (thresholding nb): Demonstrates simple thresholding and Otsu's method for image binarization.

# Video Processing Folder Description:
- Video Processing: This folder contains notebooks focused on video processing techniques using OpenCV, including object detection, background removal, video reading, and more.
Notebooks in this folder:
- Object Detection (object detection nb): Detects objects in videos using techniques like HSV color space, Region of Interest (ROI), and Termination Criteria.
- Video Reading (video reading nb): Reads and processes basic video files in OpenCV.
- Background Removal (bg remover nb): Uses methods like GrabCut and Background Subtraction to remove the background from videos.
- Reverse Video (reverse video nb): Reverses a given video for playback in reverse order.
- Webcam Video (webcam_video nb): Captures video from a webcam, processes it, and saves the output video to a specified location on the local machine.

# Face Detection Folder Notebooks:
- Face Detection (opencv face detection nb): Detects faces in both static images and live webcam feed using Haar Cascade classifiers.

# Images Folder Description:
Images: Contains all the sample images used for the notebooks in the "Basic Image Processing" and "Advanced Image Processing" folders.

# Sample Videos Folder Description:
- Sample Videos: Contains all the sample videos used for video processing in the notebooks. 
- It also serves as the folder where extracted images from videos are saved.
